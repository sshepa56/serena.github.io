        <h1> Tutoring & Copyediting </h1>
        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> I am a graduate of New York University and a current graduate student with over four years of experience providing academic tutoring at the college level, as well as comprehensive support throughout the college admissions process. In my work with high school and college-level writers, including my experience as a tutor at the NYU Writing Center, I have helped students improve their academic writing skills through detailed, constructive feedback and individualized instruction. I teach essential strategies that enable students to write with clarity, organization, and confidence. I offer guidance at every stage of the writing process, from initial brainstorming and outlining to final revisions. </p>

            <p> I welcome inquiries from prospective students and offer complimentary consultations. </p> 
<h3> Subjects </h3> 
        <ul>
            <li> College writing: research writing in any field, expository writing </li>
            <li> Writing for English language learners: high school, college</li>

                <h3> Admissions Essays</h3>
        <p> I am passionate about students with college application essays. I understand that the admissions process can often be overwhelming, and my objective is to demystify it by offering clear, actionable feedback in a supportive environment. I assist students in developing compelling essay topics, refining their ideas, and producing polished, error-free final drafts that reflect their authentic voice. In addition, I am available to support students with program selection, admissions planning, résumé and extracurricular list development, and effective responses to supplemental essay prompts.

I felt so unsure about my supplemental essays for college, but she would pop into my google doc throughout the week and provide feedback/proofread! She was SO passionate in helping me finish my essay, and she even stayed to make sure I felt confident in what I'm submitting! HIGHLY recommend this tutor! - senior (admitted to Brown) </b>  </blockquote>
