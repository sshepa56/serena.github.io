        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a graduate of New York University and a current graduate student
          with over four years of experience providing academic tutoring at the
          college level, as well as comprehensive support throughout the college
          admissions process. In my work with high school and college-level
          writers, including my experience as a tutor at the NYU Writing Center,
          I have helped students improve their academic writing skills through
          detailed, constructive feedback and individualized instruction. I
          teach essential strategies that enable students to write with clarity,
          organization, and confidence. I offer guidance at every stage of the
          writing process, from initial brainstorming and outlining to final
          revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I welcome inquiries from prospective students and offer complimentary
          consultations.

          <h3>Admissions Essays</h3>
          <p>
            I am passionate about supporting students with college application
            essays. I understand that the admissions process can often be
            overwhelming, and my objective is to demystify it by offering clear,
            actionable feedback in a supportive environment. I assist students
            in developing compelling essay topics, refining their ideas, and
            producing polished, error-free final drafts that reflect their
            authentic voice. In addition, I am available to support students with
            program selection, admissions planning, résumé and extracurricular
            list development, and effective responses to supplemental essay
            prompts.

              “Serena S. was so encouraging when I was struggling
              with my essays! I felt so unsure about my supplemental essays for
              college, but she would pop into my Google Doc throughout the week
              and provide feedback and proofreading. She was SO passionate in
              helping me finish my essay. She made sure I felt
              confident in what I was submitting! Highly recommend working with her!”
